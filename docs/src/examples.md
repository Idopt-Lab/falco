# Examples

This section contains examples demonstrating how to use FALCO for various aircraft modeling and analysis tasks.

## Getting Started with Examples

The examples are organized into two main categories:

### Basic Examples
Fundamental examples that introduce core concepts such as geometry definition, axis system setup, loads solvers (such as aerodynamics and propulsion), mass properties calculations, and condition setup. These examples provide a solid foundation for understanding the framework's capabilities for static analysis.


### Advanced Examples
Comprehensive, step-by-step examples demonstrating capabilities of the framework for more advanced workflows in the optimization process. These include trim optimization, geometry parameterization, and coupled design optimization. These examples are designed to showcase the framework's flexibility and power in aircraft design and analysis. These form the basis of further analyses such as dynamic analysis, stability and control analysis, and performance optimization.
