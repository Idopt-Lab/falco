This package provides a comprehensive aircraft flight simulation framework called FALCO for modeling and analyzing aircraft dynamics, control systems, and flight performance characteristics.

The FALCO simulator enables researchers and engineers to simulate various aircraft configurations, flight conditions, and control methodologies through a modular, python-based framework built using csdl_alpha. The simulator is capable of integrating multi-fidelity aerodynamic models, propulsion models, and control systems to evaluate flight performance. This enables rapid gradient-based aircraft design optimization.

Key features include:
- Six-degree-of-freedom aircraft dynamics modeling
- Configurable aerodynamic, propulsion, and stability models
- Modular architecture supporting custom aircraft configurations
