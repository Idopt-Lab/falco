    "Let's now import the actual geometry of the aircraft. The geometry is imported from a STEP (.stp) file, which is a common format for 3D models. It is a common output of OpenVSP and other CAD software. The geometry is imported using the `import_geometry` function. This function relies on the `lsdo_geo` library, which is a part of the LSDO (Large-Scale Design Optimization) framework. \n",

REPO_ROOT_FOLDER is a variable that points to the root folder of the flight simulator repository, but you can adjust the `file_path` parameter to point to the location of your stp file if it is not in the specified folder. The `scale` parameter is set to `in2m`, which converts the dimensions from inches to meters, as the simulation framework operates in SI units, but the original stp model was output in inches from OpenVSP. The `rotate_to_body_fixed_frame` parameter is set to `True`, which means that the geometry will be rotated to align with the body-fixed frame. This is taken as x increasing from nose to tail (longitudinal), y increasing from left to right (lateral), and z increasing from top to bottom (vertical). This means the z axis is pointing downwards, which is the standard convention for flight dynamics analysis. \n"

    "Next we will talk about how to assign specific subsets of geometries from your .stp file to a variable. This is done using `declare_component` method from lsdo_geo's `Geometry` class. You would be interested in doing this if you want to manipulate specific parts of the geometry, such as wings, fuselage, or rotors independently instead of the entire aircraft geometry. In `declare_component`, you can specify the `function_search_names` parameter, which is a list of names that will be used to search for the components in the geometry. Depending on your output settings from OpenVSP, these names may vary. You can find the names of the components in the .stp file by opening it in a CAD software or by searching the .stp file in a text editor. The `name` parameter is used to assign a name to the component, which can be used later to reference the component in the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice some searches include multiple names, such as tails searching for the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer. This grouping, separate from the horzTail and vertTail, allows for flexibility in the geometry definition, as it allows you to reference the entire tail assembly without needing to specify each part individually for a desired manipulation while still allowing you to do so if desired. An example manipulation would be the coupled move of the horizontal and vertical stabilizers forward by the same few inches while retaining the ability to independently increase each individual tail's surface area to retain control authority."
