# Mass properties alone test
# - Loads due to mass properties at 0 pitch angle
# - Loads due to mass properties at non-0 pitch angle

# Aero alone test
# - Aero produces loads at wind axis -> wing axis -> FD body-fixed axis
# - L/D when cruise motors are off < L/D when cruise motors are on
# - CL when HLP are off << CL when HLP are on

# Prop alone test
# - If CM axis location is offset from FD axis, there is a pitch moment
# - CM left is on; CM right is off. There is a yaw moment
# - When both CM are ok; there is no yaw moment







# todo: after Aviation paper
# - Test parameterization solver when aircraft components are defined in a heirarchy
